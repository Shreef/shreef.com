# Shreef.com's source code

Hey, This is Shreef!

You found where I keep the source code of my blog (shreef.com).
My blog used to live in a shared hosted WordPress. After a lot of headaches,
I decided to just move to some simpler setup. Netlify and Jekyll seemed like
a good option.

You will find here the posts too, not just the source code!

## How to install



```bash
sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev ruby-bundler

sudo gem install jekyll

jekyll new shreef.com

cd shreef.com

bundle install

bundle exec jekyll serve
```
